# Concept Document for The Long Game

## Basic Concept
* A browser game, hosted on the ObieSource website
* The game is multiplayer, each player controls a character in the game
* Players may move objects around the world and build structures(?)
* The world changes through procedural growth and decay without player intervention.

## Mechanics
* Player movement
* Picking up/placing items
* Procedural change
* NPC interaction?

### Player Movement

### Object interaction
* Player should be able to move objects around the world.
* Would be nice if player could built structures??? But I think that would require a lot more mechanics such as:
	* Inventory
	* Perhaps crafting

### Procedural change / Environment Interaction

#### Trees
* Trees drop seeds in nearby tiles, seeds grow to saplings, which grow to seeds
* Maybe: Trees can burn down/light other trees
	* Tree fire could be caused by flowing lava or lightning strike or Summer?
* Maybe player can plant crops down the line??

#### Water
* Maybe: distinguish between standing and flowing water?
	* Flowing water erodes things in its path
	* Streams grow to rivers
* Need some way to remove water - drought?
* Rain
	* World event
	* Maybe: Increases plant growth by a tick
	* Maybe: Increases size of pools of standing water - causes streams

#### Seasons
* How long should they be??
* Changes trees, causes snowfall

#### Tectonic plates??????
* Maybe just for the meme?
* Would produce volcanoes and earthquakes, and perhaps define continents if the map is that big?

### NPC Interaction??

## Content Ideas
* Volcano
	* Also earthquake/plate-related changes
* Forest growth
	* Related plant growth through birds dropping seeds
* NPC(?) who grants a wish of a world event
